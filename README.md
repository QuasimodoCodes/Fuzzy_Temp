## Development of a HVAC, Two - stage Fuzzy Logic System for Occupancy Detection and 15 Minute Temperature Forecasting using the SML2010 Dataset


An intelligent building assistant designed to make smart, explainable heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) decisions.

## 🌱 How to run the project locally

### 1) Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuasimodoCodes/Fuzzy_Temp.git
cd Fuzzy_Temp
```
### 2) Create and  Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3) Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
pip install jupyter
```
### 4) Run the Jupyter Notebook and open
```bash
Fuzzy_system.ipynb
```
The easiest way for the examiner to review and run the entire system is through:

1.  **Open `Fuzzy_system.ipynb`** in a Jupyter or Colab environment.
2.  **Run the cells sequentially.** This allows direct inspection of the fuzzy logic implementation, data handling, and $\Delta T$ prediction visualization.

This notebook includes:

- Complete fuzzy logic implementation
- Occupancy detection
- 15-minute temperature forecasting
- All membership functions and fuzzy rules
- Visualizations
- HVAC decision logic
- Example inputs and outputs

**The examiner can run everything from this notebook alone — no need to run the full chatbot application.**

## 🌱 Project Structure

The project includes the full pipeline and visualization components. **For examination and easy viewing of the logic and visualization, the primary component is the Jupyter Notebook:**

* **`Fuzzy_system.ipynb`**: Contains the **whole pipeline**, including logic, training, **visualization of fuzzy sets and rules**, and testing. **Examiners can run everything here without the full app setup.**
  * **Assistant Files:** Used for the deployed web application:

## 🌱 Live Demo

Try the interactive chatbot below:

**[Open the Fuzzy Room Temperature Assistant](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chonthichar/fuzzy-room-temperature-assistant)**

* **Predict Temperature** ($\Delta T$ in 15 mins)
* **Detect Occupancy** (Fuzzy level [0-1])
* **Decide HEAT/COOL/OFF** (Optimal action)
* **Explain using AI** (Transparent decision-making)

## 🌱 Project Implementation and Core Logic

This assistant uses a combination of technologies: **Fuzzy Logic** for occupancy and prediction, a **Mamdani FIS** for action selection, an **OpenAI LLM** for explanations, and **Gradio** for the UI.

The assistant answers the question: *"Should the HVAC system heat, cool, idle, or turn off in the next 15 minutes?"*

**Example Input:** The user provides the sensor data: `21, 12, 400, 60` (Indoor Temp, Outdoor Temp, CO₂, Lighting).

### 1. Fuzzy Occupancy Detection

Uses CO₂ and Lighting levels to infer occupancy in the range **[0-1]**.

* **Rule Example:** Low CO₂ and Dark room $\rightarrow$ Room is empty. High CO₂ and Bright room $\rightarrow$ Room is occupied.
* **Mechanism:** Uses **6 fuzzy rules** with membership functions for **low/medium** and **high** inputs.
### 2. Fuzzy Temperature Prediction (15 Minutes Ahead)

Predicts the temperature change ($\Delta T$) using a Mamdani FIS trained on the SML2010 dataset.

* **Inputs:** Indoor Temperature, Outdoor Temperature, and Fuzzy Occupancy (from Step 1).

### 3. HVAC Decision Layer

Determines the final HVAC action based on the predicted future state:

* **If room is occupied:** Too cold $\rightarrow$ **HEAT\_ON** | Too warm $\rightarrow$ **COOL\_ON** | Comfortable $\rightarrow$ **IDLE**
* **If room is empty:** Turn **OFF** HVAC to save energy.

### 4. AI Generated Explanations (using OpenAI)

The LLM generates comprehensive, natural explanations that include: Why the temperature is predicted to change, why **HEAT/COOL/OFF** was chosen, why the specific **occupancy** was inferred, and what the **best energy action** should be.

### 5. Gradio Chat Interface

The user can interact with the system by:

* **Sending Sensor Data:**
    ```
    - 21 12 400 60
    ```
* **Asking Natural Questions:**
    ```
    - Who are you?
    - What should HVAC do?
    - Explain the decision
    ```

##  🌱 Deployment Process

This project is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** using **Gradio**. You can deploy by pushing the code to a Space, or by running the Jupyter Notebook `Fuzzy_system.ipynb` inside the Space.

##  🌱 Dataset

The model uses a slice of the **SML 2010 Smart Home Dataset**, specifically `NEW-DATA-1.T15.txt`.

* **Data Included:** Indoor temperature, Outdoor temperature, CO₂ sensor, and Lighting.
