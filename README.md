# Fuzzy Temperature Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project implements a Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for short-term room temperature prediction using the SML2010 dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Objectives
- Predict room temperature 15 minutes ahead
- Compare fuzzy system performance against baseline models
- Evaluate comfort range accuracy (±0.5 °C)

## Dataset
SML2010 dataset - Smart Home monitoring data with temperature, HVAC, and environmental sensors

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-fuzzy, scikit-learn

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb` - Main implementation notebook
- `plan.json` - Project execution plan
- `problems_log.md` - Issues and solutions log
- `features_backlog.md` - Future enhancements
- `data/` - Dataset storage (created during execution)
